I recommend Anna Krystalli\u0026rsquo;s talk on UseR! 2020\n Binder and R? \rI got to know Binder thanks to the Ines Montani tutorial framework. In this framework, Binder allows you to run the code of the exercises interactively.\nOne of the benefits of Binder is being able to share Shiny apps, although it has some disadvantages compared to shinyapps.io. \u0026ldquo;Binderized\u0026rdquo; Shiny apps take longer to build but it is still an interesting alternative when leaving an application as part of a publication. It also has no restrictions on the number of apps that can be left for free. In addition, by simply changing the URL that we use to call the app, Binder allows us to access the same project using the RStudio IDE.\n If you want to deploy your Shiny app using shinyapps.io you can find instructions in this webpage\n A short time ago I participated in CarpentryCon, not only helping in the translations of lessons into Spanish, but also giving a small workshop with Pablo Bernabeu on Reproducibility and Open Science where I briefly explained the use of Binder for R users.\nIf you want to know more about Binder, I suggest The Turing Way book. The Turing Way is another community that I recommend you follow if you are interested in the topic of open science and reproducibility.\n Tutorials: Binder is part of the In√©s Montani framework for R and Python tutorials and can also be used to share learnR tutorials as it is explained in this blog post\n Slides \r\rI prepared these slides as part of a meetup to present the first ReproHack in Spanish to be held at the LatinR 2020 conference.\nIn these slides you can find:\n  Different ways to capture computational environments\n  A brief overview of the renv package\n  What Binder is\n  Steps to share interactive environments with Binder.\n  \rSlides in English.\nSlides in Spanish.\nFinal note Due to changes to Docker terms of service on November 1st the lack of activity for 6 months may cause the sharing link to become inactive.

To pass the certification there are two exams. In this post, I am going to share a 15 minute class that I prepared to as part of the teaching exam.\nWhat to teach about? \r\rI use loops frequently for my postdoc as I need to automate tasks. That is why I decided to teach two specific examples of iteration using functions in purrr package. I find that these examples are motivating for students as these functions offer a simple way to get a lot of work done:\n  Read a group of files with the same extension and get a dataframe using map_df()\n  Generate Rmarkdown reports from a list of parameters automatically with pwalk()\n  \r\rWho is the class for? This class is part of three weeks long data analysis course for graduate students without any previous training in programming.\nThe 15 minutes are part of the last class of the course. The students already have learned basic topics as visualization, data manipulation, RMarkdown, and iteration.\nSome considerations   To answer the the exercises in \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s Practice\u0026rdquo; you need concepts that were explained in previous classes. Specially these 15 minutes should be teach after iteration and Rmarkdown .\n  It is not necessary to use Xaringan for the certification slides.\n  It is important that you practice your class keeping track of how long it lasts.\n  Files Slides Slides here\n\rLive coding The file with the code for the live coding is in Live coding.R (wait a bit until R-Studio loads)\n√∞≈∏¬ê¬±√∞≈∏¬ß¬∂\n","date":1592697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592697600,"objectID":"d3fffcd7a0dd8e69284a06d10b1109a2","permalink":"https://nostalgic-sinoussi-c542be.netlify.app/post/two-examples-of-iteration-with-purrr.en-us/","publishdate":"2020-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/two-examples-of-iteration-with-purrr.en-us/","section":"post","summary":"Slides created for the teaching exam of the RStudio certification","tags":["teaching","slides","purrr","iteration"],"title":"Two examples of iteration with purrr - Class for the RStudio certification","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Tutorials"],"content":"May 2020: Interview available on the RStudio blog about the tutorials https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/teach-interactive-course/\n The aim of this post is to provide a route map highlighting the resources available to generate your own tutorial.\n Hello Last year I helped to transform some courses from a DataCamp format to Ines Montani framework. Here you have some examples of tutorials created with this framework.\nAfter one busy year that included the end of my PhD finally I have some time to make a contribution to the community about how to build these tutorials.\nWhy to use Ines Montani framework? 1- Ted Laderas has written some \u0026ldquo;pros and cons\u0026rdquo; of using this framework in this post in the RStudio education blog explaining the differences between Ines' framework with learnr package.\n2 - Ines Montani documentation is really detailed. If you find problems in building the tutorial I strongly suggest you came back to her repo.\n Do you teach a class using R and have a course that wants to convert to a tutorial? A course designed to be taught in a classroom is not exactly the same as an online tutorial. In the book Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson you can read more about the differences.\n Recipe for an interactive tutorial √∞≈∏‚Äú¬ù 1. Ingredients First, you have to divide your course into chapters. As a general rule there are 4 or 5 chapters in a tutorial.\nThe chapters can have:   Slides with explanatory text associated\n  Codeblock exercises\n  Multiple choise exercises\n  √∞≈∏¬§‚Äì\n You can use decampr package to generate some of the basic file structures.\n 2. Copy the repository √∞≈∏¬è¬Å You should have an account on GitHub (it is free). If you do not know how to do this, please check the following webpage. If you want more information about git and GitHub in relation to R, I recommend the online book Happy git with R by Jenny Bryan.\nThe course starter R repository is on GitHub. You can get a copy using it as a template.\n Remember that this framework is available for Python too.\n 3. Custom elements √∞≈∏‚Äú¬¶ Slides with text  √∞≈∏‚Äú¬Å slides folder  The slides are markdown (.md) files. It is good idea to name the file according to the chapter number and order of appearance, for example chapter2_01.md. How is the structure of the slides file? Ines described it here    Codeblock  √∞≈∏‚Äú¬Å exercises folder  Each exercise file has an associated a solution file (and ideally a test file) Tests are not fully developed yet. The names for each file should have the same reference number:    \r Multiple choise exercises  √∞≈∏‚Äú¬Å chapters folder  There are not specific files for them, are generated inside each chapter file. Read more about them in the documentation    √¢≈°¬†√Ø¬∏¬è\n Remember to include an id if more than one choice question is present in one exercise! You have an example here, in the second exercise\n Chapters   √∞≈∏‚Äú¬Å chapters folder\n Each chapter is a markdown (.md) file. Chapter structure: you should include the name of the slides, exercises and solution files.    Do not forget √∞≈∏Àú¬Æ   Customize the meta.json file with the information corresponding to your course.\n  Add a profile picture and logo too! -\u0026gt; √∞≈∏‚Äú¬Å static folder.\n  √¢≈°¬†√Ø¬∏¬è\n Remember include the logo in .svg format! You can convert a .png or .jpg image to this format online\n 3. **Cooking!**√∞≈∏¬ç¬≥ Have you added all your files to you repository? Now it is time to see if it works!\nRemember to read the Section: Setting up Binder and checking that the file install.R has all the packages used in the tutorial -\u0026gt; √∞≈∏‚Äú¬Å binder folder.\nYou will have to use Binder in your repo. This can take a while! √¢¬è¬∞\nMeanwhile, you can start your account in Netlify for the deploy as Ines did, but this step could be skipped. Why to use netlify? I found this blogpost of Yihui Xie with an explanation. It is up to you!\nAs soon as you are using Netlify you will be able to visualize the changes that you are making in the tutorial. The code will not work in codeblock exercises until you use Binder in your repository.\n4. Customization √∞≈∏¬ç‚Äô  To add a summary and a course description as introduction Change logo size  modifying width argument after .logo Change the colors Modify theme.sass Add a licence badge! You have to add it in the meta.json file.  \nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n5. Something is missing √¢≈°¬†√Ø¬∏¬è\nRemember that tests are not fully developed yet!. For more info, read the last section of the documentation.\nBon app√É¬©tit √∞≈∏¬ç¬Ω! Now you have your online tutorial ready to feed the community!\nYou can make a pull request to this repository that collects all the courses generated with this framework and other useful material to build your own course.\nThanks I want to thank Noam Ross, Julia Silge, Ines Montani and Ted Laderas for deciding to leave the material of their courses for free.\n","date":1585353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612575533,"objectID":"c7546887cdf297a4679c6f7f934a17e6","permalink":"https://nostalgic-sinoussi-c542be.netlify.app/post/cooking-your-first-tutorial.en-us/","publishdate":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cooking-your-first-tutorial.en-us/","section":"post","summary":"An initial guide on how to start an interactive tutorial from scratch using Ines Montani framework","tags":["Tutorials","Ines Montani","Framework"],"title":"Recipe for your first interactive tutorial","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Shiny"],"content":"Motivation I started to develop Shiny apps because of my research. The development of a Shiny app for the analysis of toxicological databases allowed me to explore the data in relation to different criteria.\nWhere to publish? After finishing the app, my first question was whether to publish the Shiny app. Should I include it as supplementary material of other paper or could be published as software itself?\nI got valuable suggestions in the RStudio Community forum including a list of possible journals accepting Shiny apps, in the following thread. I found also a lot of resources in this post: In which journals should I publish my software? By Neil Chue Hong. Finally, I decided to try with The Journal of Open Source Software.\nOne advantage of publishing the code itself is that the journal' review process focused on how to release the code as open source software, a concept that as researchers we are barely familiarized.\nAs an example, I included a file to indicate how users could contribute to my Shiny app and a license. I probably would not have done any of these steps of trying to publish the Shiny App as supplementary material of a paper.\nHow good does my Shiny app have to be? It depends on the publication venue. In my experience with JOSS, you have to make your software available in an open repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) and include an OSI approved open source license. Read more here about the other requirements.\nSome considerations:\n  Make the Shiny app into an R package\n  Add a DOI for the Repository\n  Add version numbers\n  Include community guidelines. For this you can use the function usethis::use_tidy_contributing()\n  My first \u0026ldquo;shiny\u0026rdquo; paper Finally, last year I published a first Shiny app to analyze ecotoxicological databases.\nD‚ÄôAndrea et al., (2019). shinyssd v1.0: Species Sensitivity Distributions for Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment.
